# Tour-of-heroes

Well documented example for learning purpose <br />

This Tour of Heroes project provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular <br />

In this Tour of Heroes project, you will build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes <br />

This app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data <br />
By the end of this tutorial you will be able to do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.</li>
  <li>Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.</li>
  <li>Use one-way data binding for read-only data.</li>
  <li>Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.</li>
  <li>Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.</li>
  <li>Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.</li>
  <li>Format data with pipes.</li>
  <li>Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.</li>
  <li>Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.</li>
</ul>

You'll learn enough Angular to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do.
