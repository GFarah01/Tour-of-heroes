# Tour-of-heroes
This Tour of Heroes project provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular <br />

In this Tour of Heroes project, you will build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes <br />

This app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data
